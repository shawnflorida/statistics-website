    <!-- One-Way ANOVA -->
    <div class="content" id="ANOVA">
      <h2 class="heading">One-Way ANOVA</h2>
      <p>
        One-way ANOVA is a statistical test used to analyze the difference between the means of more than two groups. It
        uses one independent variable and one quantitative dependent variable. ANOVA tells you if the dependent variable
        changes according to the level of the independent variable. You can use a one-way ANOVA when you have collected
        data about one categorical independent variable and one quantitative dependent variable. The independent
        variable should have at least three levels (i.e. at least three different groups or categories). The null
        hypothesis (H0) of ANOVA is that there is no difference among group means. The alternative hypothesis (Ha) is
        that at least one group differs significantly from the overall mean of the dependent variable.
      </p>
      <p>
        To compute One-way ANOVA, you can use the following formula:
        <br>
        where:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>SST = sum of squares total</li>
        <li>SSB = sum of squares between groups</li>
        <li>SSW = sum of squares within groups</li>
        <li>k = number of groups</li>
        <li>n = total number of observations</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        To interpret the result given by One-way ANOVA, you can use post-hoc testing which is used to determine which
        groups are significantly different from each other. There are several post-hoc tests available such as Tukey’s
        HSD, Bonferroni correction, Scheffe’s method, and others.
      </p>

    <!-- T-Test -->
    <div class="content" id="t-test">
      <h2 class="heading">T-Test</h2>
      <p>
        T-Test is a statistical test that is used to compare the means of two groups. It is often used in hypothesis
        testing to determine whether a process or treatment actually has an effect on the population of interest, or
        whether two groups are different from one another.
      </p>
      <p>
        To compute T-Test, you can use the following formula:
        <br>
        where:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>x̄1 = mean of sample 1</li>
        <li>x̄2 = mean of sample 2</li>
        <li>s1 = standard deviation of sample 1</li>
        <li>s2 = standard deviation of sample 2</li>
        <li>n1 = size of sample 1</li>
        <li>n2 = size of sample 2</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        To interpret the result given by T-Test, you can use the p-value which is the probability that the difference
        between the two groups is due to chance. If the p-value is less than or equal to your significance level
        (usually 0.05), then you can reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is a significant difference
        between the two groups.

    <!-- Pearson’s Correlation -->
    <div class="content" id="PC">
      <h2 class="heading">Pearson’s Correlation</h2>
      <p>
        Pearson’s Correlation is a statistical test that measures the strength and direction of the relationship between
        two quantitative variables. It is a number between –1 and 1 that measures the strength and direction of the
        linear relationship between two variables. Pearson’s r is the most common way of measuring a linear correlation.
        Pearson’s r describes the linear relationship between two quantitative variables. These are the assumptions your
        data must meet if you want to use Pearson’s r: Both variables are on an interval or ratio level of measurement.
      </p>
      <p>
        To compute Pearson’s Correlation, you can use the following formula:
        <br>
        where:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>r = Pearson correlation coefficient</li>
        <li>Σ = sum of</li>
        <li>x = variable 1</li>
        <li>y = variable 2</li>
        <li>n = number of observations</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        To interpret the result given by Pearson’s Correlation, you can use the following rules of thumb:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>r > 0 indicates a positive association</li>
        <li>r < 0 indicates a negative association</li>
        <li>r = 0 indicates no association between the variables</li>
        <li>The closer r is to -1 or 1, the stronger the association between the variables</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <!-- Spearman Rho  -->
    <div class="content" id="SR">
      <h2 class="heading">Spearman Rho</h2>
      <p>
        Spearman Rho is a statistical test used to measure the strength and direction of the relationship between two
        variables. It is a non-parametric test which means that it does not assume that the data is normally
        distributed. Instead of using the actual values of the variables, it uses their ranks. The Spearman correlation
        coefficient (ρ) is a number between -1 and 1 that measures the strength and direction of the relationship
        between two variables.
      </p>
      <p>
        To compute Spearman Rho, you can use the following formula:
        <br>
        where:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>ρ = Spearman correlation coefficient</li>
        <li>di = difference between ranks</li>
        <li>n = number of observations</li>
      </ul>
      <p>To interpret the result given by Spearman Rho:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>ρ > 0 indicates a positive association</li>
        <li>ρ < 0 indicates a negative association</li>
        <li>ρ = 0 indicates no association between the variables</li>
        <li>The closer ρ is to -1 or 1, the stronger the association between the variables</li>
      </ul>

    <!-- Chi-Square -->
    <div class="content" id="CS">
      <h2 class="heading">Chi-Square</h2>
      <p>
        Chi-Square is a statistical test used to determine whether there is a significant association between two
        categorical variables. It is used when you have two categorical variables from a single population and you want
        to know if one of the variables affects the other. The test is used to determine whether the observed
        frequencies in each category are significantly different from the expected frequencies.
      </p>
      <p>
        To compute Chi-Square, you can use the following formula:
        <br>
        where:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>χ2 = chi-square statistic</li>
        <li>O = observed frequency</li>
        <li>E = expected frequency</li>
      </ul>
      <p>To interpret the result given by Chi-Square:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          If χ2 is greater than the critical value from the chi-square distribution table with degrees of freedom equal
          to (r - 1) x (c - 1), then you can reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is a significant
          association between the two variables.
        </li>
        <li>
          If χ2 is less than or equal to the critical value from the chi-square distribution table with degrees of
          freedom equal to (r - 1) x (c - 1), then you cannot reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is no
          significant association between the two variables.
        </li>
      </ul>
