    <h2>One-Way ANOVA</h2>
    <p>
      One-way ANOVA is a statistical test used to analyze the difference between
      the means of more than two groups. It uses one independent variable and
      one quantitative dependent variable. ANOVA tells you if the dependent
      variable changes according to the level of the independent variable. You
      can use a one-way ANOVA when you have collected data about one categorical
      independent variable and one quantitative dependent variable. The
      independent variable should have at least three levels (i.e. at least
      three different groups or categories). The null hypothesis (H0) of ANOVA
      is that there is no difference among group means. The alternative
      hypothesis (Ha) is that at least one group differs significantly from the
      overall mean of the dependent variable.

    <h2>T-Test</h2>
    <p>
      T-Test is a statistical test that is used to compare the means of two
      groups. It is often used in hypothesis testing to determine whether a
      process or treatment actually has an effect on the population of interest,
      or whether two groups are different from one another.

    <h2>Pearson’s Correlation</h2>
    <p>
      Pearson’s Correlation is a statistical test that measures the strength and
      direction of the relationship between two quantitative variables. It is a
      number between –1 and 1 that measures the strength and direction of the
      linear relationship between two variables. Pearson’s r is the most common
      way of measuring a linear correlation. Pearson’s r describes the linear
      relationship between two quantitative variables. These are the assumptions
      your data must meet if you want to use Pearson’s r: Both variables are on
      an interval or ratio level of measurement.
    </p>

    <h2>Spearman Rho</h2>
    <p>
      Spearman Rho is a statistical test used to measure the strength and
      direction of the relationship between two variables. It is a
      non-parametric test which means that it does not assume that the data is
      normally distributed. Instead of using the actual values of the variables,
      it uses their ranks. The Spearman correlation coefficient (ρ) is a number
      between -1 and 1 that measures the strength and direction of the
      relationship between two variables.
    </p>

    <h2>Chi-Square</h2>
    <p>
      Chi-Square is a statistical test used to determine whether there is a
      significant association between two categorical variables. It is used when
      you have two categorical variables from a single population and you want
      to know if one of the variables affects the other. The test is used to
      determine whether the observed frequencies in each category are
      significantly different from the expected frequencies.
